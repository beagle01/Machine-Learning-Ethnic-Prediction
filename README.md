# Machine-learning-on-NHANES-2005-2006-dataset
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The NHANES combines personal interviews and physical examinations, which focus on different population groups or health topics. The surveys examine a nationally representative sample of approximately 5,000 persons each year. These persons are located in counties across the United States, 15 of which are visited each year. For NHANES 2005-2006, there were 10,348 persons selected for the sample, 10,122 of those were interviewed (79.3 percent) and 9,643 (75.6 percent) were examined in the mobile examination centers (MEC). 

In this analysis I have utilized the dataset of DS13 Examination-Body Measurements collected in the survey and tried to determine the linkage of race/ethnicity (RIDRETH1) to other variables like body weitht (BMXWT), standing height (BMXHT), body mass index (BMXBMI), upper leg length (BMXLEG), maximal calf circumference (BMXCALF), upper arm length (BMXARML), arm circumference (BMXARMC), waist circumference (BMXWAIST), thigh circumference (BMXTHICR), triceps skinfold (BMXTRI),  subscapular skinfold (BMXSUB), gender (RIAGENDR), age (RIDAGEYR). The responsive variable RIDRETH1 was predicted. The other variables listed above were used as explanatroy vaiables.

I want to find what algorithm would be good on this problem. The scatter matrix plots show that some of the variables are partially linearly separable in some dimensions. So I'll evaluate some simple linear algorithms like Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Stochastic Gradient Descent. I'll also evaluate nonlinear algorithms K-Nearest Neighbors, Classification and Regression Trees, Random Decision Forests, Extremely Randomized Trees, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines, and Neural network model Multi-layer Perceptron.
